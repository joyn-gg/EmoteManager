# note: do not import .image in case the user doesn't want it
# since importing image can take a long time.
# Do not import .emote_client, either, because otherwise running python -m utils.image
# will cause utils.image to appear in sys.modules after import of package 'utils' but
# prior to execution of 'utils.image' which may result in unpredictable behavior.
